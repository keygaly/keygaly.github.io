							  	<p id="blurb">
							  		I'm a Singer-Songwriter, Freelance Journalist, and Social Media Assistant with over 10 years experience in publishing.  I've always seen myself as an artist but, most recently, I've also begun to see myself as a builder. When I began producing music more than twenty years ago, I didnâ€™t realize I was beginning a lifelong learning process that would lead me to my latest passion as a web developer. As a recent Fellow of the NYC Tech Talent Pipeline Program, I've learned that web development and music software share a lot in common, in that it is always changing, always evolving.  My experience in music production and being exposed to music producers conditioned me to always stay open and prepared to learn.  Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has broadened my experience.
